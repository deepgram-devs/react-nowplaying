A cross-browser cross-device friendly React context to auto-play audio in a browser.

## Demo

See it in action here: [https://react-nowplaying.vercel.app](https://react-nowplaying.vercel.app/?utm_source=readme.md)

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm i react-nowplaying
```

### Add to your project

Import the React context provider;

```tsx
import { NowPlayingContextProvider } from "react-nowplaying";
```

And, just as any custom context provider, wrap the part of your app you need to be context aware in the custom provider's tags.

```tsx
// layout.tsx

//...

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>
        <NowPlayingContextProvider>{children}</NowPlayingContextProvider> // e.g. custom provider tags wrap entire body of app
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Play Blob data

Now, you can provide your data `Blob` to the play function.

```tsx
export default function MyComponent() {
  const { play } = useNowPlaying();

  const playAudio = () => {
    // get your audio blob
    play(blob, "audio/mp3");
  };

  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={() => playAudio()}>
      Play Audio
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Play a URL string

Now, you can provide your url `string` to the play function.

```tsx
export default function MyComponent() {
  const { play } = useNowPlaying();

  const playAudio = () => {
    // get your audio blob
    play("https://your-file.com/audio.mp3", "audio/mp3");
  };

  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={() => playAudio()}>
      Play Audio
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Audio Controls

Using our context's hook, we return native controls from the `<audio>` native, with the exception of `play()`. If you `pause()` your audio, you can now use `resume()`.

The `player` property is also available from the hook, which is a native reference to our `<audio>` tag, giving you the ability to add your own event listeners and control it as you need to.

```ts
export default function MyComponent() {
  const { pause, resume } = useNowPlaying();

  //... build your controls
}
```

## How It Works

In our recent project, we faced challenges with automatically playing audio across different browsers and devices, including Safari, Firefox, and all iOS devices. Our solution involved complex adjustments to enable automatic playback of audio files (in Blob format) received from our API. Instead of utilizing the Web Audio API, we opted for a workaround that involves a hidden audio element on the webpage. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- When audio is ready to play, the webpage updates a hidden audio element with the audio source and type, allowing the audio to play automatically.
- We created a custom hook that exposes an instance of the audio element, making it easier to manage playback. The hook extends the interface of an audio element.

This approach allows for seamless audio playback across a wide range of browsers and devices, ensuring users have a consistent experience.
